For a TWSBR we will need an ESP32/8266 with H bridge Motor Driver, MPU-6050 sensor, 2 DC Encoder geared motors, battery and a rigid frame 
We would need to control the whole robot with the PID Algorithm
The negative feedback would be provided by our microcontroller and encoder dc motors

Kp, Ki, Kd will be denoted as the coefficients for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms respectively
We will need to tweak the values of all three constants to prevent our twsbr from tumbling and overshooting in any direction
(I was not able to attach any pictures to this)
U(t) = Kp*e(t) + Ki*integral(e(t)) + Kd*derivative(e(t))
U(t) = Kp*(e(t) + (1/Ti)*integral(e(t)) + Td*derivative(e(t)))

Ti and Td are Integral time and Derivative time respectively

With correct configuration and pin arrangment we will be able to control a twsbr
